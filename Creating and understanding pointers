1. Pointers are elements that contain the address of a varaible. Instead of  using th normal var name to change the value, we can
use the pointer and the adress will be assigned the new value.

2. Typical way of assigning a new value to an exsiting var. Note that it will add  additinal bytes to the application run time.
int var = 5;
var = 10;

3. Now with a pointer we will use the address to assign a new value and not the var itself.

int var = 5;
// Below we use "*" to create the pointer and assign it to the variable address.
int *p = &var;
// Below we assign the address a new value of 10.
*p = 10;
