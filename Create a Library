1. In C we do not have classes, and thus do not have the luxury of inheritence or polymorphism. What we can do is create libraries
we can use the functions defined in the library where we include the library. 

2. Create one .c file and one .h file in the root directory

3. .c file

int addition(int a, int b){
    return a + b;
}

4. .h file

#ifndef CPROJECTONE_RKMATH_H
#define CPROJECTONE_RKMATH_H
    int addition(int, int);
#endif //CPROJECTONE_RKMATH_H

5. run command gcc -c *.c
6. run command ar -cvq librkutils.a *.o
7. now in main.c include the library.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "rkmath.h"
int main() {
    int x = addition(2,2);
    printf("%d", x);
    return 0;
}
