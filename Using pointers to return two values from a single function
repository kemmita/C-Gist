1. Below we access the address of the two vars and pass them within the params
#include <stdio.h>

void doWork(int a, int b, int c, int *psum, int *qmax){
    *psum = a + b + c;
    if(a > b && a > c){
        *qmax = a;
    } else if(b > a && b > c){
        *qmax = b;
    } else{
        *qmax = c;
    }
}
int main() {
    int sum;
    int max;
    doWork(14, 16, 87, &sum, &max);

    printf("The max amount entered was %d, while the sum of the amount entered was %d \n ", max, sum);
    
    return 0;
}
